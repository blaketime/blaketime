**Hi, I'm Blake**

I'm a designer and developer. Basically, I just like making things.

I'm comfortable designing interfaces, building out the frontend, or wiring up the backend. Whatever gets the thing built.



**Currently**

Building Foob and Cremini. More on these soon!



**Stack**

Figma, React, Astro, Supabase, Tauri, Unity
